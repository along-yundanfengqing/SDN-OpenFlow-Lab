This installs OpenvSwitch, KVM, Git(Hub) and an OpenFlow
Controller FloodLight (optional). It also downloads a 16Mb
linux-0.2.img.bz2 file that from http://wiki.qemu.org that
is great for testing networking since it is so lightweight
you can simulate lots of VMs running in nested a hypervisors 
on your laptop or older desktop rather than needing a server 
for learning or labbing. This is for Ubuntu only since it is 
using apt-get for pkg management. This is NOT for anything 
other than labbing and testing but the KVM and OpenvSwitch 
install would run production easily. Feel free to use this 
however you like. Python is a great language for 
infrastrcuture applications. It has clean
abstraction leaving it easy to read but also has the power
of object oriented programming. This wil install a fully
working Software Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow
lab in a few minutes. See the accompanying post
I recommend starting in a VM using VMware Fusion as the
first option only becuase it seems to deal with OVS better
than VirtualBox but both work. I would also recommend using 
snapshots heavily. Install your base Linux 12.04 build and
then take a snapshot in case you have problems with the
App you can rollback to the original snapshot and start over
